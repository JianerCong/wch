*** DONE pure data Tx <2024-01-30 Tue>
🦜 : How to we support this.

🐢 : The first thing we're gonna do is to add a field to our `Tx`.
#+begin_src c++
string type;
#+end_src

For now the allowed values are:
#+begin_src c++
{"", "data"}
#+end_src

The first means, well, the default, this is an EVM tx. The second means this is
an pure-data tx (innocent tx), ie. no VM of any type will be initialzed, and the
executor will just return `ok` for this kinda Tx.

🦜 : So what about our rpc ?

🐢 : Our rpc expects an array of Tx right?

🦜 : Yeah

🐢 : And if user did pass a `type` field in a Tx, then we add that to our Tx,
else, we leave it blank.
*** DONE unix domain socket
